** CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL CODE **
The following MATLAB functions have been directly copied to the current project
dirichlet_sample.m
SampleTransitionMatrix.m

In our main Gibbs sweep (in IHMMgibbs.m) we have used a code snippet from 
iHmmSampleGibbs.m that calculates Dirichlet Process contribution 
to the conditional density. 
It has been indicated with comments in the code where this snippet appears.
The iHmmHypersample.m function has been modified in the input, such that
the transition matrix is pre-calculated and now passed in as an argument
instead of the state-sequence.


******  mvgammaln.m ******
The multivariate log-gamma function was implemented by Dahua Lin ()
